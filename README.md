# Rapifoo
A complete Enterprise level MERN full stack app for food delivery 
MongoDB - Storage
Express - Backend ( with mangoose for connection )
ReactJs - Frontend
NodeJs - Backend (core)

This project is developed during the internship at EY GDS in collaboration with AICTE

The key insights are 
  - Login/Signup page using Auth0.
  - Frontend page for both client and restaurent owner.
  - Backend using express,node,strip(for transactions) etc.
  - It has tracking tool embedded in it using a open source project(but its mostly not polished yet i will be updating it further).

I removed .env file for protecting my data so if you are cloning it kindly make sure you create your own .env file with requred attributes.

Also this project is something i created back in 2023 with reading just react dev, mongoose, express, mongoDb and tailwind css docs

Kindly check other repo regarding ReactJs backend dev or MERN stack for newer and cleaner version of this.
